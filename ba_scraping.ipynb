Flight boarded smoothly and on time. A380 upper deck. Old club world seating which is beginning to age a little. However, like the large toilets on this aircraft type. Cabin crew were all fantastic. One family had tech issues with their seats and entertainment systems which crew worked hard on though sadly without success. Food and drink options were all very good. Entertainment was good. Overall an enjoyable flight.'"
